	<h1 class="history1"> JUSTICE LEAGUE </h1>
	<p class="lorem">Justice League is a 2017 American superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name. Produced by RatPac-Dune Entertainment,[N 2] DC Films, Atlas Entertainment, and Cruel and Unusual Films and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and the follow-up to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[7][8][9] Directed by Zack Snyder and written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Ciarán Hinds. In the film, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg after the death of Superman to save the world from the catastrophic threat of Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons.

Warner Bros. began to develop a live-action Justice League film in 2007 with George Miller set to direct, but the project was canceled due to production delays and budgetary concerns. A Justice League film would re-enter development as part of Warner Bros' upcoming DC film slate in October 2014, with Snyder on board to direct and Terrio attached to write the script. The film was initially titled Justice League Part One, with a second film (under the name Justice League Part Two) intended to follow in 2019. However, the sequel was indefinitely delayed to accommodate the production of a standalone Batman film starring Affleck. Principal photography took place from April to October 2016. After Snyder stepped down from the film following the death of his daughter, Whedon was hired to oversee the remainder of post-production, including writing and directing additional scenes, as well as reshooting a large portion of the film, which changed many aspects of it; Snyder ultimately retained sole credit as director. With an estimated production budget of $300 million, Justice League is one of the most expensive films ever made.

Justice League premiered in Los Angeles on November 13, 2017, and was released in the United States on November 17, 2017. The film grossed over $657 million worldwide against a break-even point of $750 million, becoming a box office bomb and losing Warner Bros. Pictures an estimated $60 million. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences and cast performances but criticized the plot, writing, pacing, villain, humor, computer-generated imagery, and Whedon's direction. Its tone was also met with a polarized reception, with some appreciating the lighter tone compared to previous DCEU films and others finding it inconsistent and unnatural. In the wake of its release, fans began to push for the release of Snyder's original version of the film; Warner Bros. decided to move forward with the project in February 2020. It was released as Zack Snyder's Justice League on HBO Max on March 18, 2021.

	<p class="lorem"> This flower symbolises absolute purity, youth, sincerity, and discretion. But most importantly, it symbolises happiness. This joyful symbolism means that it’s very important to give someone you love a bunch of lilies of the valley on the 1st of May.

This tradition of giving lilies of the valley is an old Germanic custom: a tribute to Ostara, the goddess of the coming of spring and the growing light. In order to honour this important goddess, the Germanic peoples threw lilies of the valley into celebratory bonfires as a sign of respect and to show that they believed in her divinity. </p>
	<p class="lorem">Is it lily of the valley, or lily-of-the-valley? Lillium convallium, Convallaria majalis or May lily? The good news is that it’s all correct. The Latin name was Lillium convallium. Now the Latin name is Convallaria majalis. Convallis means ‘valley’ and majalis means ‘of the month of May’. This adorable flower is a member of the lily family, so it was given the common name of lily of the valley.</p>
